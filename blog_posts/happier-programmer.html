        <h3>Things I did that made me a happier programmer</h3>
        <h5>November 25, 2016</h5>

        <br>

        <p>
        There are at least as many ways to grow as a programmer* as there are folks who have pushed past "Hello World", but I've found many of the things that have given me the largest gains in my programming skill or "programming comfort" have could be considered as much "life skill" as programming learning hack. Being a full-time human and part-time programmer, sometimes knowing when to get that cup of tea or take a trip to the bathroom* is even more powerful than any individual project or skill I've pushed myself through.

        Here are a few of the "hacks" I've learned that have made me the happiest.
        </p>

        <h5>I learned to break things down</h5>
        <p>
        Some stuff about some stuff.
        </p>

        <h5>I asked for feedback one step at a time</h5>
        <p>
        More stuff about stuff.
        </p>

        <h5>I tried realize when I was chasing my tail</h5>
        <p>
        Even more stuff.
        </p>

        <h5>I learned the programming "hygiene" that mattered to me</h5>
        <p>
        When I was a teenager, I went to a two-week survival training in the dry mountains of New Mexico. Our trainers (and lifelines, it seemed) were Air Force pararescuemen who had taken time out of their lives to teach a few dozen kids how to "survive" in those dusty mountains. We did the usually things: we navigated, built shelters, and learned important lessons about self-care, food, and teamwork. We also dealt with a convincingly faked injury, sang songs make up the evening before every morning before breakfast, and did more ardeniline-filled exhale-as-you-do-down-or-sputter-dust pushups than I care to count. Those of you who know how smelly I can be when showers are readily avalible won't be surprised to know that by day five, I was monitoring two sores on my foot, I had the start of an infection on my elbow, and the chapstick-and-dust mixture that had gathered around my mouth had earned me a few nicknames.

        At the beginning and end of the experience, we had fitness tests that needed to be passed for us to complete the program. Very occasionally, it would become clear that our trainers cared about something I had almost stopped thinking about: Comfort. I remember one such moment, a day before the test which would determine if we would complete the program, when one of them came to the front of our formation and, breaking character, told us that folks who were taken care of themselves - folks who were clean - did better on physical exams. He then got back to the gruff and told us what we all smelled like and gave us some pushups, but I had heard him trying to give us a leg up. I remembered that that night as I did my best and blotted my feet with my damp, dirty socks, in college when I showered before each exam even if I had been neglecting myself until then, and this last Tuesday when I closed the 724 tabs that were draining my computer's memory and causing programs to crash as I was trying to work. Sometimes, being "clean" about how you do things really does matter.

        I spent a lot of my time at the Recurse Center thinking about what many would call programming "hygiene" - patterns and habits that might take some time to establish now but allowed you to meet later goals (like reading your code in a week, for one!). I encourage everyone to sit back and notice not only the code itself but how they code (ie. Does anything slow them down when they are in the moment? Does anything make it hard to re-enter a project after time away?). Once you're given a name to the whatever-it-is that makes you pause and decide to get some tea instead of opening your terminal, you're ready to make changes that are likely to bring you real progress. Here are a few changes that have been important to me in the last few months. 

        <h6>Make your Git commits make sense</h6>
        I started using the "p" flag to make sure each of my Git commits solved one (and only one) problem at a time. This meant that when I reviewed my commit history, I can am browsing, in my commit messages, a useful history if features and solutions, instead of the hodge-podge commit messages past me would write, enumberating each of the unrelated changes I had made during whatever time period I was working - until I decided that I couldn't stand to lose my changes. So much better to be able to 


        <h6>Declutter your life - your computer life, that is</h6>
        The bottom line is that you really need to close your browser tabs. Many of you are hemming and hawing, just as I am every time someone who looks over my shoulder and see my tab count.

        As sad as I was to see my tabs go, defending my right to hoard tabs that I may sometimes use, but they where hurting my productivity in a couple of ways:
        - Having a lot of tabs open in the background, may keep you from being able to do the task you are actively working on. *find some way to measure thing*
        - In my case, the back and forth motion I was using with my wrist when I switched between tabs *ahem, stackoverflow + 200-odd other things I swore I was going to read* and my actual work was not only wasting a lot of time as I searched for things but also causing wrist pain, which any programmer will tell you can bring your work to a grinding halt. I experimented with some pretty extreme ways to ween myself from my trackpad, including [taping over my trackpad](*link to image*). Do whatever it takes!

        <h5>I remember to feed good</h5>
        <p>
        Find ways to remind yourself that you're actually quite awesome and do them often. * , the * at Etsy says in her book* that you should "pause and eat a donut" to make sure you celebrate each presentation, important discussion, or review. Most of us would agree that, in theory, some time should be taken before we jump back on the rabbit wheel*, but I've found it took a major event for me to feel worthy of even a small, smile-inducing celebration. So I decided to make it part of my every day. 

        *I would say hamster wheel, but I like rabbits a lot better.

        Praise often
