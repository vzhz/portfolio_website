        <h3>What a Permissions Issue Taught Me about Personalizing Apps</h3>
        <h5>Feburary 28, 2018</h5>

        <br/>

        <p>
          Some time ago, I made <a href="https://github.com/vzhz/friendly_terminal" target="_blank">a terminal app</a> that pulls randomly from a list of encouraging phrases I'd written and prints one to my terminal when I open it in the morning. It was a bit of encouragement for my future self.
        </p>

        <p>
          <center><img src="https://github.com/vzhz/friendly_terminal/blob/master/friendly_terminal_preview.png?raw=true" width="552" height="111" alt="screenshot of the output of my terminal application. At the top of the terminal screen is the encouraging output 'Veronica, what fabulous thing are you making today?'"><br/><h5>My terminal app gave me encouragement every morning and even knew my name!</h5></center>
        </p>
          
        <p>
          This is the story of a choice I made when building it ended up causing a massive pain in my neck. The app consists of a set number of phrases, one of which is selected at random and printed to the terminal by a Python script that is run from your <code>.bash_profile</code> when the terminal is opened.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had completely forgotten about this app when I was attempting to install the package manager Homebrew and my command line started insisting that I, from my Admin account, was not an admin. This was pretty puzzling since I have no account on my computer but Admin and Guest. After a great deal of Googling and <code>crtl+F</code>-ing (I even opened and searched the raw version of the Homebrew install for usr and USER), I remembered that I had set my <code>USER</code> to "veronica" in my .bash-profile so my terminal would print my name in its nicities. 
        </p>

        <p>
          That line is now safely commented out and I am able to "brew" my way to other things. My plan is eventually to go back and do what I would have liked to had the foresight to do in the first place: Set the <code>USER</code> to a variable in the .bash-profile instead of hard-coding it.
        </p>
