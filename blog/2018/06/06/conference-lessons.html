        <h3>Seven Lessons From My Conference Marathon  
</h3>
        <h5>June 6, 2018</h5>

        <br/>

        <p>
          Attending conferences is by far one of the best ways to meet people in your field and be introduced to concepts that you may not see in your current day-to-day, but attending successfully takes planning. Set yourself up to come back to your work refreshed and with some new ideas to try out, a handful of business cards, and (always) a tote-bag of swag t-shirts. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I recently participated in (including presenting at!) three conferences in the course of three weeks, and anyone who has attended even one will tell you that getting the most out of a conference experience requires planning and self-knowledge. Here’s a list of considerations I found helpful during the two-week conference “marathon” that I just finished. 
        </p>

        <h5>Minimize your regrets</h5>
        <p>
          I always want to be as efficient as possible, and (downside to perfectionism) it can be hard to make decisions. I’ve found, in situations with many good choices, it’s helpful to make the choice that I expect I will regret the least. This is my “golden rule” of conference decision-making.
        </p>

        <h5>Define your own goals</h5>
        <p>
          When every choice you make means missing something else, it can be really helpful to set your own goals ahead of time. For example, the first time I attended PyCon, I primarily attended talks and “dipped my foot in the water” of unconference activities by attending one "open space" discussion. I spoke to people over lunch and ran around the expo hall enough to realize that some people had gotten O'Reilly coloring books, and, no, I had not been fast enough to get one of my own. This year, I decided to attend only a small number of sessions, because now I knew I would be almost as happy seeing them online. Instead, I spent most of my time talking to people, some of whom I now consider friends. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I felt I had “conferenced” to my fullest each time, and I was only able to do that because I had started the week with a plan for what I would compromise on and what I would prioritize. And yes, during my latest trip around the expo hall, the O’Reilly booth was one of the first on my list.
        </p>

        <h5>Prepare yourself for a deluge of new ideas</h5>
        <p>
          It’s far easier to be ready for new ideas while sitting at your desk, tea and notebook in hand, anticipating new challenges. When you’ve been traveling, are feeling drained and perhaps overloaded, learning can be difficult. At home, we’re likely to say “my brain is full,” and do whatever it takes to for us to come back to the problem fresher, but at a conference, it rarely feels there is time and space.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve found that each time I attempt to push my understanding day-in-and-day-out for that length of time, I’m vulnerable to all-or-nothing thinking (when things are going well: “this is learning, and I’m doing great!”; once I see something confusing: ”ohno, I don’t even know how to approach this”). This recently happened when I found an open source project I was excited to contribute to, only to open their code and have the “I know nothing” ego-crash.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve found there are a few things that I do that ease this feeling:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Think about what topics and technologies you’d like to learn, and evaluate how much background you have for each topic. While learning a bit about something new is a fantastic use of your conference time (remember, a lot of people go to conferences to discover what they want to learn next), the slightly disoriented “newb” feeling is a stressful one to sit with and it’s helpful to say “this might be hard for me, but I’m going anyway!”
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to attend at least one event which you care about but have some mastery each day. You will probably retain more if you attend talks/events that you expect to have a range of personal difficulty levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you have a “know nothing” moment, remind yourself of something you’ve figured out, a time you were resourceful, etc. I have a whole folder of screenshots of programming moments I’m proud of, and they remind me that I’ve found my bearings before and can do it again. Having a handful of proud moments at the top of your mind can really help bring you back into growth-mindset when it starts to slip.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>Make conversation nice for others</h5>
        <p>
          Conferences can be an exciting but overwhelming experience, so be the welcoming, kind person that you would like to meet. Everyone knows a few people that they enjoy running into, so look for ways to be that person! One acquaintance, as a conversation opener, asked what I looked forward to at the conference. Regardless of your work/life situation, or how ready you feel to give an elevator pitch, everyone comes to a conference excited about *something* and it’s a much more low-pressure starting point than “tell me about you [your career]” from a colleague! Be a person that works to put other people at ease. You’ll have more candid conversations and everyone will walk away with a smile on their face.
        </p>

        <h5>Maintain routines</h5>
        <p>
          Even the small adjustments you make to be comfortable in your daily life can make a big difference. Don’t skimp on what makes you comfortable and helps you take care of yourself. Think about your typical food needs (I’m usually carrying a sandwich bag of nuts), comfort items (falling asleep is so much easier with an eye mask), and any self-care gear that you use regularly. I keep a list and update it each time I realize that, yes, I did forget something. If you’re starting your own list, you can use [this](http://www.whatamiforgetting.com/) as inspiration.
        </p>

        <h5>Keep a wish list</h5>
        <p>
          I take note of what I wished I had brought or saw other people bring and thought “that’s genius”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next time, I plan to bring: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              A surge strip for recharging at the conference center. I saw two coworkers doing this and I have to say (a) what a great way to avoid the wall-squat-near-a-charger problem and (b) I bet this is also a great way to make new (similarly charger-hungry) friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              A set of contact cards. I’ve hesitated to do this because ordering my own felt a little self-important, but I’ve found that it’s easier to remember someone if you have a card to scribble a few words about what you talked to them about / when to connect with them.
            </li>
            <li>
              A small notepad or syncing phone app. I found myself taking notes in a number of places when I was on the go and/or when my computer wasn’t on, and I’d love to consolidate those efforts. Many I have talked to kept notes on talks, conversations, and any of their reactions they expect to wish to revisit.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>Prepare for the possible “con-drop”</h5>
        <p>
          When you attend a conference, you’re interrupting your “normal” and replacing it with a deluge of new ideas, opportunities, and the sense that we have to be “on” as much as possible. It’s perfectly normal, and perfectly ok, to come home and crash emotionally. Maybe you are overwhelmed, maybe you feel bad about your own skills after being exposed to so many ideas, maybe you start to see practices at work or in yourself that you now realize aren’t ideal but don’t feel you can implement new patterns. All this is aggravated by the stress of traveling (much harder for some than others!) and the interruption of routine. It’s normal and ok to struggle with these and other feelings post-conference, and it’s important that you make whatever space you need for yourself to be able to do that.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wish you a happy and well-prepared conference season!
        </p>
