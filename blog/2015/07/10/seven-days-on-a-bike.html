        <h3>Seven Days on a Bike</h3>
        <h5>July 10, 2015</h5>

        <br>

        <p>
        A friend of mine, Kayla, planned a bike trip from Seattle, where she is teaching for Girls Who Code, to San Francisco, where I live. Her trip was 1000+ miles in 20 days, and while the idea of spending three weeks adventuring and trying out this whole bike touring business sounded great, I decided moderation was the way to go and joined for the last week of her trip.
        </p>

        <p>
        We met in Eureka, CA (320 miles from San Francisco) and started south. We typically biked 40-50 miles a day, which left plenty of time for ice cream breaks and big-tree-investigations, tiny-town history museum visiting, or river-swimming. On the first day, I was a bundle of energy and literally started dancing and singing “goin’ bike along a river, dada daDA” during our first water/bar/map-looking break. Kayla, who was on day 13 of her journey, was more moderate in her river-excitement. It turned out the pace was great for both of us. Kayla already had soreness from her solo section, I was on my first bike trip and learning everything, and we both wanted to take the time to enjoy as much California as we could.

        <p>
        Some people set a much faster pace. Every night we would camp (mostly at state parks) and would see the same crew we had been travelling with, the 40-50 mi/day crew. People doing more than that were asleep by the time we rolled into camp at 7, 8, or 9pm and enjoying the empty road by 5am. One group that took this approach was a gaggle of old men who were, much to my amazement, doing 70 mi/day. When I woke up, they were loading up their gear and teasing each other. They joked that they would be loud and rude to the car camping crew that had stayed up late, so drunk they thought screaming would be a fun addition to their camping trip, which, in my why-were-people-yelling morning grogginess, was an image I enjoyed thoroughly. They gave their bikes one last look, took off their fuzzy, patterned grandpa sweaters (they had full racing gear underneath), and headed out before I could brush my teeth. I decided to start a gang of touring cyclists.
        </p>

        <p>
        We made friends along the way. The nice thing about going roughly the same pace as other people is that we saw the same group of people most evenings. We checked in with each other, discussed any bike trouble we had (it is amazing what other people know!), and eventually got each other’s emails and sent selfies of us at the end of our trips. I would recommend touring with a friend the first time you go. Not only is it nice to have someone to share the fun times with, but it’s also really helpful to have someone more experienced when you’re looking at your bike and wondering how worried you should be about the wear (and eventual bulge) on the wall of your tire (we did made it up and down the mega-hill that stood between us and the bike shop).
        </p>

        <p>
        People in cars were mostly friendly, which was a relief. The first day, when the burst of turbulent air from a passing semi threw my balance a little a few seconds after entering the 101, I realized, with that dull well-this-is-what-we’re-dealing-with shock, that if a car were to hit me at highway speed, I would probably die. The awareness stuck with me but I felt more confident as I went, especially after I saw how many people were willing to follow behind a bike on bridges (etc.) without being absorbed by rage. The route we were on is used by many cyclists, and I’m sure that the fact that cars were aware that we would be there and that we would be slow and vulnerable helped a lot. For every expletive I heard there were at least 10 thumbs up, short “hello” honks, and even the occasional peace sign. Thank you for the upvotes on those hills, California!
        </p>

        <p>
        One thing I’ve come to appreciate about adventures is that you are able to deal with and experience whatever is in front of you, without the choice of “switching gears” and backloading the problem. About twenty miles into my first day, I got my first flat. Kayla hadn’t gotten a flat in the first 650+ miles of the trip, so her flat-changing memories were old and fuzzy. I had watched a youtube video on bike maintenance after I started riding in 2009. We jumped in and started changing, occasionally saying things like “so I take off the tire…?” and trailing off into a question. Things got even more complicated when we realized my spare was the wrong width for my tire. Rats. I wish I had been more careful. It was patch time, and we talked about going back to the bike shop in the town we had passed 5 miles before. We were on top of a hill and neither wanted to backtrack just to be looking at the hill again. So we patched. At some point in all of this, I joked “on the bright side, think about how confident we’ll feel after this”. And it’s true, I wasn’t scared of flats and knew I could trust my patch kit after that. Only because I’d had to. And I bought two tubes of the correct size the next chance I got. Because yeesh.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’m mostly a hiker, and I have a suggestion for anyone considering a long bike trip: take only what you will need. Pack the way you would pack for the trail and then try to halve it. Think of your route, your weather, what consumables will make you happy (for me, q-tips help an otherwise dirty me feel much cleaner), and what you can leave behind, rewear, etc. Habits die hard, so I insisted on bringing the wag-bag (used for cleanliness in dig-a-hole bathroom situations) that I had gotten so used to relying on, which doesn’t make any sense when you are traveling through towns every 20 miles or so. The sanitizer and the baby wipes helped keep us clean when bathrooms were sans soap, but the toilet paper I thought I would be grateful for was just along for the ride. Very well-traveled toilet paper.

        Kayla and I were a good match as travel-buddies. Both of us were more concerned with making sure we enjoyed the experience than covering a certain number of miles a day (which for the more experienced is certainly enjoyment in it’s own right). I think the fact that we had nothing to prove to each other made us less stressed when things went wrong (nothing major: we had one map-misread that “added” several miles at the end of a long day and my bike decided it needed some extra attention a few times), and we laughed about the hard parts.
        </p>

        <p>
        There was a lot to laugh about. On the way up one particularly long, steep, shoulder-less section, I toppled into the ditch. The ditch was pretty steep, but the weeds were thick enough that they were quite springy. I assume my front tire had hit the edge of the road, but I was really tired and hadn’t remembered that happening, only that I had been thinking about how tired/hungry/etc. I was. I must have turned my wheel to far, too close to the road. From 20 feet behind me, Kayla saw me fall but said that, from what she could see, I had just toppled smoothly. I disappeared into the weeds and come out a second later covered in burrs and laughing. I told her that obviously this was my way of declaring a break.
        </p>

        <p>
        I talked more when I was tired after that, and we laughed about the time I had tried to take a nap (or maybe hide from her) for the rest of the trip. The next day (before I could fully deburr), an old man in a Safeway asked if I had an infestation of bugs on my shirt. I told him they were burrs and picked one off to show him. What else can you do when someone asks if you had walked into a grocery store with hundreds of bugs crawling on you? More comedy than expected came from that one little ”nap.”

        The scenery changed almost every day, which was utterly fantastic.
        </p>

        The first day was all dairy farms and sheep. It’s calf time, and the little cows with their mega-big eyes were adorable. In my start-of-trip-excitement, I rode alongside my friend and told her about the types of fencing, irrigation, and weeds I remembered from my childhood. I started to wish I had a camera strapped to my head since (a) I wasn’t going to stop for a picture of a cow but (b) no one would believe me if I told them how cute they were. Trust me, the cows were adorable. And farms are actually quite beautiful if you don’t immediately think of the fences you need to mend, horse poop you need to shovel, acres you need to till, etc. as you approach them.

        There were redwoods, which were green and towering trees and shade. One of the towns we drove through had “Flats” in it’s name, so I was extra happy to be starting on this stretch. Businesses in this area often had a person-sized, twisted branch placed near their entrance, which was strange both because what makes the branches twist is a fungus (so they are displaying the beauty of what is really a sick tree) and because there are so many living trees around that the branding was less impressive.

        <p>
        There was a big hill, Everett. I had noticed my tire wall budging that morning, but there wasn’t much I could do but brake gently and listen for the change in road-tire noise that would come before a blowout. There were small shoulders, tight curves, and log-laden semis, and I thought several times that there isn’t enough calmness in my entire being to stay always-alert and still push forward. By the end of the day, the bulge was bad enough that it had pushed the tire out of alignment and the wheel rubbed with every turn. I have never been so happy to have a long downhill end.

        The area surrounding Albany looked like pictures I had seen of New Zealand. We stopped by a small convenience store whose windows seemed to be the happening place to post announcements (they have both Zumba(!) and a bridge club), job notices (several hand-made signs announced that someone had a lawn blower (or similar) and wants to remove leaves (or help move things, or anything, really) for $), and political cartoons/information (an entire window was devoted to an ink-jet printed list of what had been accomplished during Obama’s presidency). The leftward lean surprised me coming from the wall of a small-town convenience store.

        There were many small things we saw that I thought were beautiful in part because (unlike the giant trees and coastal views) we didn’t expect them to be there: the decorative fence that modeled a large chain but was made out of connected wooden boxes, the hawk that came out of the steep hill along the road and took flight no more than 10 feet from me, the blackberries that seemed to always be in the steepest parts, on the sharpest curves, where we weren’t going to stop, but were awesome anyway.

        <p>
        We saw farms, forests, hills, ocean, more ocean, hills near ocean, and some of the most interesting towns I have ever been through along our route. I decided at some point that, if it didn’t exist, I wanted to make a timelapse on a gopro (or similar) camera especially for bike tours. The feeling of starting the day in flat farmland and ending near the ocean (or experiencing a similar change) again and again for days is an amazing experience and I want to be able to share it in the future, although nothing will beat the in-person surprises you get along the way. 
        <!--[edit: some gopro models allow pictures to be taken on an interval and this excellent method for stitching together photos already exists]-->
